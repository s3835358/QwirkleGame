The current player may take an actions:
-  Place a tile onto the board (command - place 'tile' at 'location')
-  Place multiple tiles onto the board (command - multiple 'tile'@'location', 'tile'@'location', 'tile'@'location' etc..)
-  Replace on tile in their hand (command - replace 'tile')
-  Save the game to a file (command - save 'filename')
-  Quit the game (command - ^D)

Once the player successfully takes their action, their turn ends, and the other player’s turn starts.

The game ends when:
- The tile bag is empty, and
- One player has no more tiles in their hand
